  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 13, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Garage Sales Manager (GSM)</strong> respects your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how the app handles user information.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Currently, GSM only collects the email address you provide during registration. This information is used solely to manage your account and sync data between your local device and our cloud database.</p>

  <p>Other features, such as connecting to WhatsApp via the Cobalt API, are handled entirely on your device. GSM does not collect, store, or transmit your WhatsApp data.</p>

  <p>All item management actions (create, edit, delete) are synced between your local system and our cloud backend (hosted on Supabase) but are associated only with your user account. We do not sell, share, or use your data for advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>Future Data Use</h2>
  <p>We may add new features in the future that involve collecting additional data. If so, we will update this policy accordingly and inform users through app updates or in-app notices.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use secure connections (HTTPS) and modern security practices to protect all communications between your device and our servers.</p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account or data at any time from within the app, or by contacting us at <strong>[youremail@example.com]</strong>.</p>
